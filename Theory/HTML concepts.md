Here are the answers to all the HTML questions from the document:

1. **What is `<!DOCTYPE html>` in HTML5?**

   - `<!DOCTYPE html>` is a declaration that defines the document type and version of HTML being used. It helps the browser to render the page correctly by switching to the standard mode instead of quirks mode, ensuring compatibility with modern web standards.

2. **What is the difference between `div` and `span` in HTML?**

   - `div`: A block-level element used to group larger sections of content, creating structure in HTML. It starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.
   - `span`: An inline element used to group small chunks of content within a line, such as text or other inline elements, without creating new lines or disrupting the flow of content.

3. **What are semantic tags and non-semantic tags in HTML?**

   - **Semantic Tags**: Tags that clearly describe their meaning and the content within them, making the structure of the page more understandable to both developers and search engines. Examples include `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>`.
   - **Non-Semantic Tags**: Tags that do not convey any information about the content. Examples include `<div>` and `<span>`, which are used for layout and styling without describing the content.

4. **What is the difference between HTML and HTML5?**

   - HTML5 is the latest version of HTML that introduced new elements, attributes, and APIs for more dynamic and interactive web pages. Key differences include:
     - **New Elements**: Such as `<article>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<canvas>`.
     - **Enhanced Forms**: Input types like `email`, `date`, `number`, and attributes like `placeholder`.
     - **APIs**: Native support for audio, video, local storage, and offline web applications.
     - **Simplified Doctype**: The doctype declaration is now `<!DOCTYPE html>` compared to the longer doctype in earlier versions.

5. **What is the `iframe` tag in HTML5?**

   - The `<iframe>` tag is used to embed another HTML document within the current document. It allows you to display content like web pages, videos, or interactive maps inside a section of your page.

6. **What are the formatting tags in HTML?**

   - Formatting tags in HTML are used to style text and content. Examples include:
     - `<b>` for bold text
     - `<i>` for italic text
     - `<u>` for underlined text
     - `<strong>` for important text
     - `<em>` for emphasized text
     - `<mark>` for highlighted text
     - `<sup>` for superscript text
     - `<sub>` for subscript text.

7. **What is the difference between `<b>` and `<strong>` in HTML?**

   - Both `<b>` and `<strong>` make text bold, but `<strong>` has semantic importance. `<strong>` indicates that the text is of great importance, whereas `<b>` only adds stylistic boldness without implying importance.

8. **What is the viewport attribute in HTML?**

   - The viewport attribute, set using the `<meta>` tag, controls the layout of the webpage on different devices and screen sizes. Common usage:
     ```html
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
     ```
   - It specifies the viewportâ€™s width and initial zoom level, making the site responsive and ensuring it scales correctly on mobile devices.

9. **What is an attribute in HTML?**

   - An attribute provides additional information about an HTML element, modifying its behavior or appearance. Attributes are placed inside the opening tag of an element, like `id`, `class`, `href`, `src`, `style`, and more. For example:
     ```html
     <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" width="200" />
     ```

10. **What are block-level and inline elements in HTML?**

    - **Block-Level Elements**: Elements that start on a new line and take up the full width available. Examples include `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<ul>`, and `<section>`.
    - **Inline Elements**: Elements that do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. Examples include `<span>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, and `<strong>`.

11. **What is the difference between HTML and HTML5?**
    - This question is the same as Question 4, so the answer is already provided above.
