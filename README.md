# Front-End Components

This repository is a comprehensive resource for front-end interview preparation. It contains solutions to commonly asked coding questions, theory-based answers to frequently asked interview questions, and front-end-specific system design concepts. With **Front-End Components**, you can confidently prepare for interviews by understanding the core principles and solving real-world problems encountered in front-end development.

## Project Overview

The repository is organized into three main sections:

1. **Solved Questions**: A collection of coding solutions for commonly asked front-end interview questions.
2. **Theory**: Detailed answers and explanations to theory-based questions often encountered in interviews.
3. **System Design for Front-End**: Concepts and strategies for front-end-specific system design, tailored for handling scalable, responsive, and efficient user interfaces.

## Getting Started

To get started with the content in this repository, you can either clone the repo to your local machine or browse directly on GitHub.

### Prerequisites

- **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS** knowledge
- Familiarity with modern front-end frameworks (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) is recommended

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devanshalok/front-end-components.git
cd front-end-components
```

## Repository Structure

1. **/Solved Questions**: Contains front-end coding problems, with solutions provided in JavaScript, focusing on areas like DOM manipulation, event handling, state management, and component structuring.

2. **/Theory**: Includes answers to theory questions that cover topics such as:
   - Core JavaScript concepts (e.g., closures, promises, async/await)
   - CSS techniques and optimizations
   - HTML best practices
   - Performance and optimization techniques for front-end
   - Common frameworks and libraries

3. **/System Design for Front-End**: Covers design principles and strategies specific to front-end development, including:
   - Designing scalable UI architectures
   - Component-driven development
   - Handling high-traffic applications
   - Optimization techniques for rendering and data fetching

## Usage

Navigate through the folders to explore solutions, theory answers, and design concepts. Each section is organized by topic for easy reference. Feel free to use this repository as a study guide or supplement your interview preparation by running the code locally and experimenting with solutions.

## Running Code Examples

Most code examples are in JavaScript and can be run directly in the browser console or Node.js. For specific frontend frameworks or library examples, you may need additional setups like **npm** and **webpack** or a local development environment.

1. Navigate to the specific question folder:

   ```bash
   cd folder/example-question
   ```

2. Run the JavaScript files in Node or within your preferred code editor.

## Built With
