Implementation Steps
HTML: Create the basic structure of the paginated address list and navigation buttons.
CSS: Style the table and pagination controls.
JavaScript: Handle rendering the addresses, managing pagination, and navigating between pages.

Explanation

HTML:
The table structure includes a header (<thead>) with columns for the index and address.
A <tbody> is used to dynamically insert rows of addresses based on the current page.
Two buttons (Previous and Next) are used to navigate through the paginated data.

CSS:
The table and buttons are styled to look clean and responsive.
Disabled buttons are styled to indicate they are not clickable.

JavaScript:
renderAddresses Function: Determines which addresses to show based on the current page and inserts the rows into the table.
Pagination Logic: The Previous and Next buttons adjust the currentPage and trigger a re-render of the table.
The buttons are disabled when on the first or last page to prevent invalid navigation.

How It Works
Initially, the first five addresses are shown.
Clicking Next shows the next five addresses, and clicking Previous shows the previous five.
The renderAddresses function is called whenever the page changes, updating the visible data accordingly.
