To implement a nested checkbox system where each parent checkbox can have multiple child checkboxes, and selecting/deselecting a parent checkbox will automatically select/deselect its children, we need the following:

Parent Checkboxes: These will control the state of the child checkboxes.
Child Checkboxes: These can be selected/deselected individually. If all child checkboxes under a parent are selected, the parent checkbox should also be selected.
Interactivity: Selecting a parent checkbox should automatically check/uncheck all of its children, and selecting/deselecting individual child checkboxes should adjust the state of the parent accordingly.

Explanation:

HTML Structure:
Each parent checkbox (.parent-checkbox) has associated child checkboxes (.child-checkbox).
The child checkboxes are indented under their respective parents for clarity.
Each parent and its children are grouped in a div with the class .checkbox-group to easily manage relationships.

CSS Styling:
Simple styles to structure the checkboxes with spacing and indentation for clarity.
Children are indented under the parent checkbox using margin-left.

JavaScript Logic:
Parent Checkbox Logic:
When a parent checkbox is clicked, all child checkboxes under that parent are selected or deselected accordingly.
Child Checkbox Logic:
When a child checkbox is clicked, the parent checkbox adjusts its state:
Checked: If all child checkboxes are selected, the parent checkbox will be fully checked.
Indeterminate: If only some of the child checkboxes are selected, the parent checkbox will show an indeterminate state (indeterminate = true).
Unchecked: If no child checkboxes are selected, the parent checkbox will be unchecked.

Indeterminate State:
The parent checkbox enters the "indeterminate" state when only some (but not all) of its child checkboxes are checked. This state visually indicates that the parent checkbox is partially selected.

How It Works:

Parent Checkbox Behavior:
Clicking on a parent checkbox will automatically check or uncheck all of its child checkboxes.

Child Checkbox Behavior:
Clicking on any child checkbox will automatically update the parent checkbox:
If all child checkboxes are selected, the parent checkbox will be fully checked.
If only some are selected, the parent checkbox will become indeterminate.
If none are selected, the parent checkbox will be unchecked.
