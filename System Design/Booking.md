### **Designing a Travel Booking Front-End System (Like Airbnb) Using the RADIO Framework**

This system will focus on building a front-end architecture for a travel booking system like Airbnb, where users can search for accommodations, manage bookings, communicate with hosts, and leave reviews. We'll follow the RADIO framework and ensure that the **Data Model** specifies the components the entities belong to, and the **API Definitions** will include pagination where necessary.

### **1. Requirements Exploration**

#### **Functional Requirements:**

- **User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Property Search:** Search for properties using filters like location, price, type, amenities, and availability dates.
- **Property Listing and Details:** View details about properties including images, descriptions, amenities, pricing, and reviews.
- **Booking Management:** Users can book properties, manage existing bookings, and cancel reservations.
- **Messaging:** Communication between hosts and guests.
- **Reviews and Ratings:** Guests can leave reviews for properties after their stay.
- **Payment Integration:** Users can pay for bookings using integrated payment gateways.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements:**

- **Performance:** The system should be responsive, with minimal loading times for property searches and details.
- **Scalability:** Must handle high traffic, especially during peak travel seasons.
- **Security:** User data and payment information should be secure.
- **Accessibility:** Should adhere to accessibility standards.
- **Offline Support:** Certain features should work offline, like viewing booked properties.

### **2. Architecture / High-Level Design**

Here is the high-level architecture, represented using an ASCII diagram, along with detailed explanations for each component:

### **Explanation of Components**

1. **Frontend Application (SPA)**:

   - **View: Property List**: Displays search results based on user queries, including properties matching their selected filters (location, price range, dates, etc.).
   - **View: Property Detail**: Shows detailed information about selected properties, including images, descriptions, amenities, and reviews.
   - **Routing Module**: Manages navigation between pages like the homepage, property details page, booking management, etc., using tools like **React Router** or **Vue Router**.
   - **State Management**: Manages the global application state, like search filters, logged-in user data, and booking information, using tools like **Redux** or **Context API**.
   - **API Integration Layer**: Handles communication with backend services via **Axios**, **Fetch**, or **GraphQL**, fetching property listings, booking details, and user profiles.
   - **UI Components**: Reusable components like property cards, search forms, booking forms, and filters that make up the visual elements of the interface.
   - **Security Layer**: Secures the front-end with **HTTPS**, **JWT** tokens for authentication, and protection against attacks like **CSRF**.
   - **Caching Layer**: Uses client-side caching tools like **SWR** or **React Query** to store previously fetched data, improving performance and reducing redundant API calls.

2. **Controller**:

   - Handles data flow, manages the interaction between UI components and the API layer, and manages state changes based on user actions.

3. **Client Store**:

   - Stores local state information, such as active search queries, saved properties, user session data, and temporary booking information.

4. **Backend Services**:
   - **Authentication Service**: Handles user login, registration, and profile management.
   - **Property Service**: Provides property search results, listings, and details based on user queries and filters.
   - **Booking Service**: Manages bookings, payments, and cancellations.

### **3. Data Model**

Below is the data model, with each entity connected to its relevant components and source:

```typescript
// Hotel Entity representing a hotel available for booking
type Hotel = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  location: string;
  rating: number; // Average user rating for the hotel
  photo_url?: string; // Image of the hotel
  amenities: string[]; // List of amenities available (e.g., "WiFi", "Pool")
};

// Room Entity representing a room within a hotel
type Room = {
  id: number;
  hotel_id: number; // Foreign key linking to the hotel
  name: string; // Name or type of the room (e.g., "Deluxe King Suite")
  description: string; // Room description (e.g., "Sea view, king-sized bed")
  price_per_night: number; // Cost per night for the room
  max_guests: number; // Maximum number of guests
  photo_url?: string; // Image of the room
};

// Booking Entity representing a hotel room booking
type Booking = {
  id: number;
  hotel_id: number; // Foreign key linking to the hotel
  room_id: number; // Foreign key linking to the room
  user_id: number; // Foreign key linking to the user
  check_in_date: string; // ISO date for check-in (e.g., "2024-10-15")
  check_out_date: string; // ISO date for check-out (e.g., "2024-10-18")
  total_price: number; // Total price for the stay
  guests: number; // Number of guests
};

// Typeahead Search Request for hotels
type SearchRequest = {
  searchQuery: string; // The location, hotel name, or keyword the user is searching for
  check_in_date: string; // Desired check-in date
  check_out_date: string; // Desired check-out date
  guests: number; // Number of guests
  start_from: number; // For pagination, starting point for results
  limit: number; // Number of results to return
};

// Search Result Type with Pagination for Hotels and Rooms
type SearchResult<T extends Entity> = {
  data: T[]; // Could be a list of hotels or available rooms
  pagination: {
    start_from: number;
    limit: number;
    total: number; // Total number of results for this query
  };
};

// Client State for Storing Current Search and Booking State
type ClientState = {
  searchQuery: string;
  searchResults: SearchResult<Entity>; // Holds current search results (hotels or rooms)
  recentQueries: string[]; // Cached search queries
  selectedHotel?: Hotel; // Hotel selected for booking
  selectedRoom?: Room; // Room selected for booking
  currentBooking?: Booking; // Holds the current booking information (if in progress)
};
```

### **4. Interface Definition (API)**

Below is the interface definition, including pagination for search results and reviews:

- **User APIs**:

  - `POST /login` - Authenticates the user.
    - **Parameters**: `{ email, password }`
    - **Response**: `{ token, userDetails }`
  - `GET /user/profile` - Fetches the profile of the currently logged-in user.
    - **Parameters**: `token`
    - **Response**: `{ user_id, name, email, bio, profile_picture, bookings }`

- **Property APIs**:

  - `GET /properties?location={location}&check_in={date}&check_out={date}&page={page}&limit={limit}` - Fetches paginated property listings based on search filters.

    - **Parameters**: `location`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `page`, `limit`
    - **Response**: `{ properties: [ { property_id, name, price, location, images } ], total_pages }`

  - `GET /property/{property_id}` - Fetches detailed information about a specific property.
    - **Parameters**: `property_id`
    - **Response**: `{ propertyDetails }`

- **Booking APIs**:

  - `POST /booking/create` - Creates a new booking.

    - **Parameters**: `{ user_id, property_id, check_in, check_out }`
    - **Response**: `{ booking_id, status }`

  - `GET /booking/{user_id}?page={page}&limit={limit}` - Fetches a list of user bookings with pagination.
    - **Parameters**: `user_id`, `page`, `limit`
    - **Response**: `{ bookings: [ { booking_id, property_id, check_in, check_out, status } ], total_pages }`

### **5. Optimizations and Deep Dive**

- **Performance**:

  - Use lazy loading for images on the property listings and detail pages.
  - Implement code splitting and bundle optimization to reduce initial load times.

- **Scalability**:

  - Use horizontal scaling for backend services and distribute traffic using a load balancer to handle high traffic during peak seasons.

- **Security**:

  - Use **OAuth 2.0** for secure user authentication.
  - Secure all API endpoints with **JWT** tokens and ensure communication is encrypted using **HTTPS**.

- **Offline Mode**:
  - Implement local storage for user sessions and save certain data (like saved properties) for offline access.

### **Summary**

This design provides a detailed front-end system architecture for a travel booking application like Airbnb. The design includes the **Frontend Application (SPA)** with key components like the **Routing Module**, **State Management**, **UI Components**, **API Integration Layer**, **Security Layer**, and **Caching Layer**. The **Data Model** specifies the components each entity belongs to, and the **API Definitions** incorporate pagination for a smoother user experience. The architecture is scalable, secure, and optimized for high performance.
