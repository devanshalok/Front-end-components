### **Designing a Flashcard Web App for Learning a Foreign Language Using the RADIO Framework**

This system design focuses on building a **web app** that helps users learn a foreign language using **flashcards**. The flashcards will have a **front side** showing a word in the user’s **native language** and a **back side** that reveals the word in the **foreign language** when the card is hovered or clicked.

We will use the **RADIO framework** to structure this design, ensuring the app is **scalable**, **user-friendly**, and supports multiple language pairs.

---

### **1. Requirements Exploration**

#### **Functional Requirements:**

- **Flashcard Display:** Each flashcard shows a word in the user’s native language. On hover or click, it flips to reveal the translation in the foreign language.
- **Deck Management:** Users can choose or create flashcard decks for specific topics or languages.
- **Progress Tracking:** Track user progress, such as how many cards they've reviewed or mastered.
- **User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and save their learning progress.
- **Language Pair Selection:** Users can select their native language and the target foreign language.
- **Learning Modes:** Provide different modes for learning, such as review mode (viewing cards one by one), quiz mode (input the translated word), and spaced repetition mode.
- **Responsive Design:** The app should work on mobile and desktop devices.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements:**

- **Performance:** Fast loading times, especially for large decks of flashcards.
- **Scalability:** Should scale to handle large numbers of users and support multiple languages and decks.
- **Security:** Secure user data and protect user progress with proper authentication and authorization.
- **Accessibility:** Should meet accessibility standards for screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- **Offline Support:** Users should be able to review flashcards offline with cached data.

### **Explanation of Components:**

1. **Frontend Application (SPA)**:

   - **View: Flashcard Grid**: Displays the list of flashcards in the selected deck. Users can click or hover on cards to flip them, revealing the foreign language translation.
   - **View: Flashcard Detail**: Displays a single flashcard with controls to flip the card, go to the next card, or change learning modes (e.g., quiz mode).
   - **Routing Module**: Manages navigation between decks, learning progress, settings, and flashcard modes (e.g., review, spaced repetition), using **React Router** or **Vue Router**.
   - **State Management**: Manages the application’s global state, including the user’s current deck, flipped cards, mastered words, and progress, using **Redux** or **Context API**.
   - **API Integration Layer**: Connects the front-end to backend services for managing flashcards, tracking user progress, and handling user authentication using **Axios** or **Fetch API**.
   - **UI Components**: Reusable UI components like flashcards (with flipping animations), decks, progress bars, and settings buttons for switching languages or modes.
   - **Security Layer**: Ensures secure communication and access to user progress and flashcards using **HTTPS**, **JWT tokens** for authentication, and encryption for sensitive data.
   - **Caching Layer**: Uses **SWR** or **IndexedDB** to cache flashcards and user progress, enabling users to review their flashcards even when offline.

2. **Flashcard Controller**:

   - The logic that handles user interactions with flashcards, such as flipping the card, advancing to the next card, and marking cards as mastered. It manages different learning modes like spaced repetition, quiz mode, and review mode.

3. **Learning State Management**:

   - Manages the user’s progress, including which cards have been reviewed, mastered, and which ones are due for review based on spaced repetition algorithms. It also tracks the user’s overall progress in different decks.

4. **Backend Services**:
   - **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication using **OAuth**, allowing users to sign up, log in, and securely save their progress.
   - **Flashcard Decks Service**: Manages the storage and retrieval of flashcard decks, including translation pairs in different languages. It also supports user-created decks.
   - **Progress Tracking Service**: Tracks user progress in each deck, including the number of cards reviewed and mastered. This data can be used to provide insights and suggestions for improvement.

---

### **3. Data Model**

The data model defines key entities related to users, flashcards, and progress. Each entity is linked to specific components and their sources:

- **User Entity**:

  - **Fields**: `user_id`, `name`, `email`, `profile_picture`, `language_preferences`, `decks[]`
  - **Component**: Authentication Service, Client Store
  - **Source**: OAuth, User Service API

- **Flashcard Entity**:

  - **Fields**: `card_id`, `deck_id`, `front_text`, `back_text`, `flipped_status`, `created_at`
  - **Component**: Flashcard Detail, Flashcard Grid, State Management
  - **Source**: Backend Database, Flashcard Decks Service

- **Deck Entity**:

  - **Fields**: `deck_id`, `user_id`, `language_pair` (e.g., English-Spanish), `name`, `cards[]`, `created_at`
  - **Component**: Deck Selection, API Integration Layer
  - **Source**: Backend Database, Deck Service API

- **Progress Entity**:
  - **Fields**: `progress_id`, `user_id`, `deck_id`, `cards_reviewed`, `cards_mastered`, `last_reviewed`
  - **Component**: Learning State Management, Flashcard Controller
  - **Source**: Backend Database, Progress Tracking Service

### **4. Interface Definition (API)**

Below are the **API definitions** for the flashcard learning system, including pagination for handling large sets of cards.

- **User APIs**:
  - `POST /login` - Authenticates the user using OAuth

. - **Parameters**: `{ email, password }` - **Response**: `{ token, userDetails }`

- **Flashcard APIs**:

  - `GET /decks?user_id={user_id}&page={page}&limit={limit}` - Fetches a paginated list of decks for a user.

    - **Parameters**: `user_id`, `page`, `limit`
    - **Response**: `{ decks: [ { deck_id, name, language_pair } ], total_pages }`

  - `GET /deck/{deck_id}/cards` - Fetches all flashcards in a specific deck.

    - **Parameters**: `deck_id`
    - **Response**: `{ cards: [ { card_id, front_text, back_text } ] }`

  - `POST /deck/create` - Creates a new flashcard deck.
    - **Parameters**: `{ user_id, language_pair, name, cards[] }`
    - **Response**: `{ deck_id, status }`

- **Progress APIs**:

  - `POST /progress/update` - Updates the user’s progress for a specific deck.

    - **Parameters**: `{ user_id, deck_id, cards_reviewed, cards_mastered }`
    - **Response**: `{ status, progress_id }`

  - `GET /progress/{user_id}/deck/{deck_id}` - Fetches the user’s progress in a specific deck.
    - **Parameters**: `user_id`, `deck_id`
    - **Response**: `{ progress_id, cards_reviewed, cards_mastered, last_reviewed }`

---

### **5. Optimizations and Deep Dive**

- **Performance**:

  - Use **lazy loading** to load only a subset of flashcards when the user navigates through a deck, improving the initial loading speed.
  - Implement **pre-fetching** of the next few flashcards to make transitions smooth when navigating between flashcards.

- **Scalability**:

  - Use **horizontal scaling** for backend services to handle large user bases and many concurrent requests when users are reviewing flashcards simultaneously.
  - Implement **distributed databases** to manage flashcard decks and user progress across multiple regions for faster access.

- **Security**:

  - Use **JWT tokens** for secure user authentication and session management, ensuring user progress and flashcard data are protected.
  - Encrypt user data and sensitive flashcard content using **SSL/TLS** for secure communication between the client and the server.

- **Offline Mode**:
  - Implement offline functionality using **IndexedDB** or **Service Workers** to store flashcard decks locally, allowing users to review flashcards even without an internet connection. Sync changes once the user is back online.
