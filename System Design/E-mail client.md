### **Designing a Desktop Email Client Front-End System Using the RADIO Framework**

An **email client** is a **desktop application** that enables users to manage multiple email accounts, send/receive emails, and access email services from providers like **Gmail**, **Outlook**, and **iCloud**. Unlike **webmail**, which requires a browser, desktop email clients like **Microsoft Outlook**, **Mozilla Thunderbird**, and **Apple Mail** provide offline capabilities and can integrate multiple email services under one app.

This design will focus on creating the front-end architecture for a **desktop email client** system that can interact with multiple email service providers using protocols such as **IMAP**, **SMTP**, and **POP3** for email management, with offline capabilities for viewing and composing emails.

---

### **1. Requirements Exploration**

#### **Functional Requirements:**

- **Account Management:** Users should be able to add and manage multiple email accounts from different providers (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo).
- **Email Composition:** Ability to compose and send emails, with support for attachments, CC, BCC, and formatting.
- **Email Viewing:** Users can view received emails, including headers, body, and attachments, with support for HTML or plain text emails.
- **Email Folders and Filtering:** Display folders (Inbox, Sent, Drafts, Trash) and allow sorting and filtering of emails.
- **Synchronization:** Sync emails with the server, download new emails, and update changes (e.g., read/unread status, deleted emails).
- **Offline Access:** Users can view previously downloaded emails and compose drafts while offline.
- **Notifications:** Notify users of new incoming emails, even when the app is minimized.
- **Search:** Ability to search through email messages by subject, sender, body text, or attachments.
- **Multiple Protocols:** Support for **IMAP**, **SMTP**, and optionally **POP3** to connect to various email providers.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements:**

- **Performance:** Fast email syncing and low-latency email sending.
- **Scalability:** Must support multiple email accounts with potentially thousands of emails in each.
- **Security:** Must encrypt email data and support secure connections to email servers via SSL/TLS.
- **Accessibility:** Full keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and compliance with accessibility standards.
- **Extensibility:** Ability to add support for additional email providers or custom features in the future.

### **Explanation of Components:**

1. **Frontend Application (SPA/Native Desktop Application)**:

   - **View: Inbox / Folders**: Displays a list of emails from the inbox, sent folder, drafts, and custom folders. It shows sender, subject, date, and read/unread status. It also provides sorting and filtering.
   - **View: Email Detail**: Shows the content of a selected email, including headers (subject, sender, date), body, and any attachments. Supports both plain text and HTML views.
   - **Routing Module**: Manages navigation between the inbox, folders, sent items, and email detail views. Allows easy switching between different email accounts and folders.
   - **State Management**: Manages the application's global state, such as the list of email accounts, loaded emails, sync status, and folders. This can be implemented using **Redux** or **Context API**.
   - **API Integration Layer**: Interacts with external email services via **IMAP** (for receiving emails), **SMTP** (for sending emails), and **OAuth** (for authentication). It handles syncing, sending, and retrieving emails from various providers like Gmail, Outlook, and iCloud.
   - **UI Components**: Reusable UI components such as inbox lists, email viewing panels, email compose windows, folders, and search bars.
   - **Security Layer**: Ensures secure connections to email servers using **SSL/TLS**. It manages **OAuth** for authentication and session management, and encrypts data (both in transit and at rest).
   - **Caching Layer**: Uses **SWR** or **IndexedDB** to cache emails, account information, and folder structure locally for offline access and performance improvement.

2. **Email Controller**:

   - The core logic that manages email sending, syncing with email servers, and updating the local state. It handles actions like marking emails as read/unread, deleting emails, and composing/sending new messages.

3. **Email State Management**:

   - Stores the current state of emails and accounts, including the list of synced emails, their read/unread status, drafts, and the state of the email folders (e.g., inbox, sent, trash). It also manages offline synchronization when users reconnect.

4. **Backend Services**:
   - **Authentication Service**: Manages user authentication using **OAuth**, allowing the app to securely connect to multiple email providers (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, iCloud).
   - **Email Provider Service**: Communicates with email providers using standard protocols such as **IMAP**, **SMTP**, and **POP3**. This service manages sending, receiving, and syncing emails.
   - **Notification Service**: Provides real-time notifications for new incoming emails using push notifications or server events.

---

### **3. Data Model**

The data model defines key entities related to emails, accounts, and folders. Each entity is linked to specific components and sources:

- **User Entity**:

  - **Fields**: `user_id`, `name`, `email`, `profile_picture`, `email_accounts[]`, `last_login`
  - **Component**: Authentication Service, Client Store
  - **Source**: OAuth, User Service API

- **Email Entity**:

  - **Fields**: `email_id`, `account_id`, `folder_id`, `from`, `to`, `cc`, `bcc`, `subject`, `body`, `attachments[]`, `timestamp`, `read_status`
  - **Component**: Inbox View, Email Detail View, Email State Management
  - **Source**: IMAP, POP3, Email Provider APIs

- **Folder Entity**:

  - **Fields**: `folder_id`, `account_id`, `name`, `email_ids[]`
  - **Component**: Folder View, Email State Management
  - **Source**: IMAP API

- **Draft Entity**:
  - **Fields**: `draft_id`, `account_id`, `to`, `cc`, `bcc`, `subject`, `body`, `attachments[]`
  - **Component**: Email Compose View, Email State Management
  - **Source**: Local Storage, IMAP API

---

### **4. Interface Definition (API)**

Below are the **API definitions** for the desktop email client, including pagination for fetching large lists of emails.

- **User APIs**:

  - `POST /login` - Authenticates the user using OAuth.
    - **Parameters**: `{ provider, email, password }`
    - **Response**: `{ token, userDetails }`

- **Email APIs**:

  - `GET /emails?account_id={account_id}&folder_id={folder_id}&page={page}&limit={limit}` - Fetches paginated emails from a specific folder.

    - **Parameters**: `account_id`, `folder_id`, `page`, `limit`
    - **Response**: `{ emails: [ { email_id, from, subject, timestamp, read_status } ], total_pages }`

  - `GET /email/{email_id}` - Fetches the full details of a specific email.

    - **Parameters**: `email_id`
    - **Response**: `{ email_id, from, to, subject, body, attachments, timestamp, read_status }`

  - `POST /email/send` - Sends a composed email using SMTP.

    - **Parameters**: `{ account_id, to, cc, bcc, subject, body, attachments[] }`
    - **Response**: `{ status, email_id }`

  - `POST /email/draft/save` - Saves a draft email.
    - **Parameters**: `{ account_id, to, cc, bcc, subject, body, attachments[] }`
    - **Response**: `{ draft_id, status }`

---

### **5. Optimizations and Deep Dive**

- **Performance**:

  - Use **lazy loading** and **pagination** when loading large numbers of emails from a folder.
  - Implement **delta synchronization** to only fetch new or updated emails instead of fetching the entire inbox every time.

- **Scalability**:

  - Use **IMAP IDLE** (push notifications for emails) to avoid polling the email server frequently for new messages, reducing server load and network usage.
  - For large email bodies or attachments, implement **on-demand loading** to fetch data only when required.

- **Security**:

  - Use **OAuth** for authentication to avoid storing email credentials directly in the app.
  - Encrypt emails stored locally (in drafts or cached emails) and use **SSL/TLS** for all communication between the client and the email provider.

- **Offline Mode**:
  - Use **IndexedDB** or **local storage** to store a local cache of emails, allowing users to read and compose drafts even when offline. Once back online, the client syncs changes (e.g., sends drafts or marks emails as read).

---

### **Summary**

This design provides a comprehensive architecture for a **desktop email client** using the **RADIO framework**. The system supports key features like managing multiple email accounts, sending/receiving emails, offline access, and synchronization with various email services using protocols such as **IMAP**, **SMTP**, and **POP3**. The **Data Model** defines how emails, accounts, and folders are structured, while the **API Definitions** include pagination for handling large datasets of emails. The design ensures security, scalability, and extensibility, allowing for a seamless email management experience on desktop systems.
