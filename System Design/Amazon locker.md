### **Designing an Amazon Locker Front-End System Using the RADIO Framework**

An **Amazon Locker system** allows customers to pick up their packages from a secure locker location, instead of home delivery. The front-end system will allow users to **find nearby lockers**, **choose a locker for delivery**, and **access their locker using a unique code or QR code** upon package arrival.

This design will follow the **RADIO framework**, ensuring the system is **scalable**, **secure**, and **easy to use**.

---

### **1. Requirements Exploration**

#### **Functional Requirements:**

- **Locker Search and Selection:** Users can search for nearby lockers by entering their location or postal code and select a locker for their package delivery.
- **Package Pickup Notification:** Users receive a notification (email, SMS, or app notification) when their package arrives at a locker.
- **Locker Access:** Users can retrieve their package by entering a unique access code or scanning a QR code at the locker.
- **Locker Availability Check:** Users can see locker availability before selecting a location.
- **Order Tracking:** Users can track the status of their order and see when it's delivered to a locker.
- **Authentication:** Users can sign in using their Amazon account to select lockers, track orders, and access delivery information.
- **Multi-Package Support:** Users can receive multiple packages in the same locker or adjacent lockers, depending on availability.
- **Secure Access:** Only the customer with the correct code or QR code can access the locker.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements:**

- **Performance:** The system should quickly find available lockers and allow users to access their lockers with minimal delay.
- **Scalability:** Must handle large volumes of users and packages across many locker locations.
- **Security:** Ensure secure access to lockers and protect user data and delivery details.
- **Accessibility:** Provide accessible features for visually impaired or disabled users.
- **Offline Support:** Enable users to access their locker codes and package details even when offline (cached data).

### **Explanation of Components:**

1. **Frontend Application (SPA)**:

   - **View: Locker Search**: Allows users to search for nearby lockers by entering their postal code or using their current location. A list of lockers is displayed with their availability.
   - **View: Order Tracking**: Displays the status of a user’s order, from shipping to delivery at a selected locker. Users can track the location of their package and view the locker address.
   - **Routing Module**: Manages navigation between locker search, order tracking, and locker access views using **React Router** or **Vue Router**.
   - **State Management**: Manages the application’s global state, including user-selected lockers, orders, and access codes, using **Redux** or **Context API**.
   - **API Integration Layer**: Communicates with backend services for searching lockers, tracking orders, and fetching access codes via **Axios** or **Fetch API**.
   - **UI Components**: Reusable components such as locker lists, tracking displays, QR codes for locker access, and status notifications.
   - **Security Layer**: Ensures secure communication and user authentication using **HTTPS**, **JWT tokens**, and **end-to-end encryption** for locker access codes.
   - **Caching Layer**: Uses **SWR** or **IndexedDB** to cache locker availability, access codes, and user orders, enabling users to access this information offline or when network conditions are slow.

2. **Locker Controller**:

   - The core logic that handles user interactions related to locker search, selection, and access. It communicates with the backend to fetch locker availability, assign locker codes, and track user orders. It also manages locker status updates and user interactions with the locker (e.g., unlocking it via a QR code or PIN).

3. **Order State Management**:

   - Manages the state of user orders, including tracking packages, locker selections, and generating access codes (QR code or PIN). It updates the UI in real-time to reflect order status changes, such as when a package arrives at the locker or is picked up.

4. **Backend Services**:
   - **Authentication Service**: Manages user sign-ins and logins using **OAuth** for secure authentication.
   - **Locker Service**: Manages locker availability, assigns lockers to user orders, and generates access codes (QR codes or PINs) for locker access.
   - **Order Service**: Tracks the status of user orders, including shipping and delivery. It updates the front-end when a package is delivered to a locker and sends notifications to users.

---

### **3. Data Model**

The data model defines key entities related to users, lockers, orders, and access codes. Each entity is linked to specific components and their sources:

```typescript
// Locker Entity to Represent a Physical Locker
type Locker = {
  id: number;
  location: string; // Address or description of the locker location
  available_slots: number; // Number of available slots for packages
  total_slots: number; // Total capacity of the locker
  operational_status: string; // e.g., "operational", "out_of_service"
};

// Package Entity for Each Delivered Item
type Package = {
  id: number;
  locker_id: number; // ID of the locker storing this package
  user_id: number; // ID of the user who owns this package
  delivery_code: string; // Unique code for user to access the package
  status: string; // e.g., "awaiting_pickup", "picked_up", "returned"
  delivery_time: Date; // Timestamp when the package was delivered to the locker
  pickup_deadline: Date; // Deadline by which the package must be picked up
};

// User Entity for Locker System Users
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  phone_number?: string; // Optional, for SMS notifications
  preferred_lockers?: number[]; // Array of locker IDs the user frequently uses
};

// Typeahead Search Request Type (for searching nearby lockers)
type SearchRequest = {
  searchQuery: string;
  start_from: number;
  limit: number;
};

// Search Result Type with Pagination for Lockers
type SearchResult<T extends Entity> = {
  data: T[]; // List of lockers
  pagination: {
    start_from: number;
    limit: number;
    total: number;
  };
};

// Client State for Storing Current Locker and Package State
type ClientState = {
  searchQuery: string;
  searchResults: SearchResult<Locker>; // Holds the current locker search results
  recentQueries: string[]; // Cached locker search queries
  currentPackage?: Package; // Current package status if tracking an order
  preferredLockers: Locker[]; // List of user’s preferred lockers for easy access
};
```

### **4. Interface Definition (API)**

Below are the **API definitions** for the Amazon Locker system, including pagination for handling large locker listings or orders.

- **User APIs**:

  - `POST /login` - Authenticates the user using OAuth.

- **Parameters**: `{ email, password }`

  - **Response**: `{ token, userDetails }`

- **Locker APIs**:

  - `GET /lockers?location={location}&page={page}&limit={limit}` - Fetches a paginated list of available lockers based on location.

    - **Parameters**: `location`, `page`, `limit`
    - **Response**: `{ lockers: [ { locker_id, location, availability, qr_code } ], total_pages }`

  - `GET /locker/{locker_id}/availability` - Checks the availability of a specific locker.
    - **Parameters**: `locker_id`
    - **Response**: `{ locker_id, availability, status }`

- **Order APIs**:

  - `GET /orders?user_id={user_id}&page={page}&limit={limit}` - Fetches a paginated list of orders for a user.

    - **Parameters**: `user_id`, `page`, `limit`
    - **Response**: `{ orders: [ { order_id, status, delivery_time, locker_access_code } ], total_pages }`

  - `POST /order/create` - Creates a new order and assigns a locker for delivery.
    - **Parameters**: `{ user_id, locker_id, items[] }`
    - **Response**: `{ order_id, locker_access_code, status }`

### **5. Optimizations and Deep Dive**

- **Performance**:

  - Use **lazy loading** for locker search results to optimize performance when loading large lists of lockers.
  - Implement **QR code generation** and locker access logic on the client side to reduce latency when accessing lockers.

- **Scalability**:

  - Use **geo-based distributed databases** for locker locations and availability data, ensuring fast access for users across regions.
  - Employ **horizontal scaling** for the order tracking service to handle large volumes of requests during peak shopping periods.

- **Security**:

  - Use **JWT tokens** for secure user authentication and session management.
  - Encrypt locker access codes using **AES encryption** and ensure secure access to lockers with **end-to-end encryption** for data transfer.

- **Offline Mode**:
  - Implement **local caching** using **IndexedDB** or **Service Workers** to store access codes, order status, and locker details locally. This allows users to retrieve their codes even when offline and enable the app to sync when online.
