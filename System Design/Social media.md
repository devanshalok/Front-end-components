### **Explanation of Components:**

1. **Frontend Application (SPA)**:

   - **View: News Feed**: Displays a personalized feed of posts from friends and pages, with the ability to like, comment, and share posts. Posts are displayed in a timeline format, with real-time updates for interactions.
   - **View: Post Composer**: Allows users to create posts by entering text, uploading media (images, videos), and adjusting privacy settings. Posts can also include tags or mentions of other users.
   - **Routing Module**: Manages navigation between different parts of the application, such as the news feed, user profile, group pages, and messaging, using **React Router** or **Vue Router**.
   - **State Management**: Manages the global state of the app, such as the current feed data, user posts, comments, likes, and shares, using **Redux** or **Context API**. This ensures the front-end state remains in sync with the backend and updates in real-time.
   - **API Integration Layer**: Communicates with backend services for retrieving posts, uploading media, tracking likes and comments, sending friend requests, and handling private messages using **Axios** or **Fetch API**.
   - **UI Components**: Reusable components like post cards, comment boxes, like buttons, notification icons, and media upload tools. These components form the building blocks of the user interface.
   - **Security Layer**: Ensures secure access to user data using **JWT tokens**, **OAuth** for authentication, and **SSL/TLS** for encrypted data transmission.
   - **Caching Layer**: Uses **SWR** or **IndexedDB** to cache post data, media, and notifications for offline access, ensuring that users can view and interact with content even when offline.

2. **Social Feed Controller**:

   - Handles user interactions with the news feed, such as loading new posts, updating likes and comments, fetching new content, and managing the user's timeline. It also communicates with the API layer to fetch, create, or delete posts.

3. **Post State Management**:

   - Stores the state of posts, including the content of posts, comments, likes, and shares. It also handles media uploads and tracks the status of interactions (e.g., how many likes a post has or whether it has been shared).

4. **Backend Services**:
   - **Authentication Service**: Handles user login, registration, and session management using **OAuth** for secure authentication.
   - **Post Service**: Manages the creation, retrieval, and updating of posts, likes, comments, and shares. It also handles user interactions with posts, such as adding comments or sharing content.
   - **Media Service**: Manages media uploads, including storing and serving images, videos, and other multimedia files.

### **3. Data Model**

The data model defines key entities related to users, posts, comments, likes, and media. Each entity is linked to specific components and their sources:

```typescript
// User Entity to Represent Social Media User
type User = {
  id: number;
  username: string;
  name: string;
  profile_photo_url?: string;
  bio?: string;
  followers_count: number;
  following_count: number;
};

// Post Entity to Represent User Posts
type Post = {
  id: number;
  author: User; // The user who created the post
  content: string; // The text or description of the post
  media_url?: string; // URL to an image, video, or other media
  created_at: string; // ISO timestamp of post creation
  like_count: number; // Number of likes on the post
  comment_count: number; // Number of comments on the post
};

// Comment Entity to Represent Comments on Posts
type Comment = {
  id: number;
  author: User; // The user who made the comment
  post_id: number; // The post that the comment is linked to
  content: string; // The comment text
  created_at: string; // ISO timestamp of comment creation
  like_count: number; // Number of likes on the comment
};

// Like Entity to Track Likes on Posts or Comments
type Like = {
  id: number;
  user: User; // The user who liked the post or comment
  post_id?: number; // The post that was liked (if applicable)
  comment_id?: number; // The comment that was liked (if applicable)
  created_at: string; // ISO timestamp of when the like happened
};

// Typeahead Search Request Type (for searching users or posts)
type SearchRequest = {
  searchQuery: string;
  start_from: number;
  limit: number;
};

// Search Result Type with Pagination for Users and Posts
type SearchResult<T extends Entity> = {
  data: T[]; // Could be users or posts
  pagination: {
    start_from: number;
    limit: number;
    total: number;
  };
};

// Client State for Storing Current User Session and Search State
type ClientState = {
  currentUser: User; // Holds the current logged-in user data
  searchQuery: string; // The current search query for users or posts
  searchResults: SearchResult<Entity>; // Holds current search results (users, posts)
  feed: Post[]; // The user's main feed showing recent posts from followed users
  notifications: Notification[]; // Holds notifications (likes, follows, comments, etc.)
};

// Notification Entity to Represent Various Actions
type Notification = {
  id: number;
  user: User; // The user who performed the action (e.g., liked, commented)
  action: "like" | "comment" | "follow"; // Type of action
  target_post_id?: number; // The post linked to the action (if applicable)
  target_comment_id?: number; // The comment linked to the action (if applicable)
  created_at: string; // ISO timestamp of when the notification was created
};
```

### **4. Interface Definition (API)**

Below are the **API definitions** for the social media system, including pagination for handling large volumes of posts and comments.

- **User APIs**:

  - `POST /login` - Authenticates the user using OAuth.
    - **Parameters**: `{ email, password }`
    - **Response**: `{ token, userDetails }`

- **Post APIs**:

  - `GET /feed?user_id={user_id}&page={page}&limit={limit}` - Fetches a paginated list of posts for the user’s news feed.

    - **Parameters**: `user_id`, `page`, `limit`
    - **Response**: `{ posts: [ { post_id, content, media_url, likes, comments } ], total_pages }`

  - `POST /post/create` - Creates a new post.

    - **Parameters**: `{ user_id, content, media_url, privacy }`
    - **Response**: `{ post_id, status }`

  - `POST /post/{post_id}/like` - Adds a like to a post.

    - **Parameters**: `{ post_id, user_id }`
    - **Response**: `{ status }`

  - `POST /post/{post_id}/comment` - Adds a comment to a post.
    - **Parameters**: `{ post_id, user_id, content }`
    - **Response**: `{ comment_id, status }`

- **Media APIs**:

### **5. Optimizations and Deep Dive**

- **Performance**:

  - Use **WebSocket connections** for real-time updates to comments, likes, and posts in the feed. This will ensure that users see live updates without refreshing the page.
  - Implement **infinite scrolling** for the news feed, loading new posts as the user scrolls down to optimize performance for large volumes of content.

- **Scalability**:

  - Use **sharding** and **horizontal scaling** for the post and media databases to handle large volumes of user-generated content.
  - Implement **content delivery networks (CDNs)** to deliver images and videos, ensuring fast loading times for media files.

- **Security**:

  - Use **JWT tokens** for secure session management and **OAuth 2.0** for user authentication.
  - Implement **end-to-end encryption** for private messages and ensure that all communications between the client and server are encrypted using **SSL/TLS**.

- **Offline Mode**:
  - Implement offline functionality using **IndexedDB** to store user posts, comments, and interactions locally. This will allow users to view their feed and write new posts while offline, with changes synced back to the server when the user reconnects.
