### **Designing Uber Eats Front-End System Using the RADIO Framework**

This system design focuses on the front-end architecture of a food delivery platform like **Uber Eats**. The platform will enable users to search for restaurants, browse menus, place orders, track deliveries, and leave reviews. We will follow the **RADIO framework** and incorporate key components such as **Frontend Application (SPA)**, **Routing Module**, **State Management**, **UI Components**, **API Integration Layer**, **Security Layer**, as well as **pagination** for the API definitions and **data model** with ownership.

### **1. Requirements Exploration**

#### **Functional Requirements:**

- **User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Restaurant Search:** Search for restaurants using filters such as location, cuisine, price range, and delivery time.
- **Menu Browsing:** View detailed restaurant menus, including dish descriptions, prices, and availability.
- **Order Management:** Users can add items to a cart, place orders, track orders, and cancel them.
- **Delivery Tracking:** Real-time delivery tracking with driver updates.
- **Payment Integration:** Users can pay for orders using various payment methods.
- **Reviews and Ratings:** Users can leave reviews and ratings for restaurants after receiving their food.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements:**

- **Performance:** Must provide real-time updates on orders and deliveries with minimal delay.
- **Scalability:** Should handle thousands of concurrent users and orders.
- **Security:** All sensitive user data and payment information must be protected.
- **Accessibility:** Must comply with accessibility standards.
- **Offline Support:** Some basic features should work offline, like viewing past orders.

### **Explanation of Components:**

1. **Frontend Application (SPA)**:

   - **View: Restaurant List**: Displays a list of restaurants based on user search and filter criteria, such as location and cuisine.
   - **View: Menu Detail**: Displays a detailed view of the selected restaurant's menu, including item descriptions, prices, and restaurant information.
   - **Routing Module**: Manages navigation between different parts of the app, like searching restaurants, viewing menus, managing the cart, and tracking orders. Implemented using **React Router** or **Vue Router**.
   - **State Management**: Manages application state (such as user data, cart, and active orders) using **Redux**, **Context API**, or similar solutions.
   - **API Integration Layer**: Interfaces with backend services to fetch restaurant data, menus, and order information via **Axios** or **Fetch API**.
   - **UI Components**: Consists of reusable components like restaurant cards, menu items, and order forms that users interact with.
   - **Security Layer**: Manages authentication, securing API requests using **HTTPS**, **JWT tokens** for user sessions, and protections against **CSRF** attacks.
   - **Caching Layer**: Implements caching for previously loaded data, using tools like **SWR** or **React Query**, to reduce redundant API calls and improve performance.

2. **Controller**:

   - The controller is responsible for managing user interactions and coordinating data flow between components. It handles actions like adding items to the cart, placing orders, and fetching real-time delivery tracking.

3. **Client Store**:

   - Manages local data such as the userâ€™s current session, restaurant data, the items in the cart, and active order details. This ensures the front-end is responsive even when the network is slow.

4. **Backend Services**:
   - **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication, registration, and login.
   - **Restaurant Service**: Provides restaurant and menu data based on location, filter criteria, and selected restaurant.
   - **Order and Payment Service**: Handles the creation and management of orders, payment processing, and real-time delivery tracking.

### **3. Data Model**

Here is the data model, with components and their sources specified:

```typescript
// Restaurant Entity for Restaurant Search
type Restaurant = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  photo_url?: string; // Image of restaurant
  cuisine: string;
  rating: number;
  delivery_time_estimate: string; // e.g., "30-45 min"
};

// Menu Item Entity for Menu Search
type MenuItem = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  price: number;
  photo_url?: string;
};

// Typeahead Search Request Type (for searching restaurants or menu items)
type SearchRequest = {
  searchQuery: string;
  start_from: number;
  limit: number;
};

// Search Result Type with Pagination for Restaurants and Menu Items
type SearchResult<T extends Entity> = {
  data: T[]; // Could be restaurants or menu items
  pagination: {
    start_from: number;
    limit: number;
    total: number;
  };
};

// Client State for Storing Current Search and Order State
type ClientState = {
  searchQuery: string;
  searchResults: SearchResult<Entity>; // Holds current search results
  recentQueries: string[]; // Cached search queries
  cart: {
    items: MenuItem[];
    total_price: number;
  };
  currentOrderStatus?: string; // e.g., "Preparing", "Out for Delivery", etc.
};
```

### **4. Interface Definition (API)**

Here is the interface definition for the system, including pagination where necessary:

- **User APIs**:

  - `POST /login` - Authenticates the user.
    - **Parameters**: `{ email, password }`
    - **Response**: `{ token, userDetails }`
  - `GET /user/profile` - Fetches the logged-in userâ€™s profile information.
    - **Parameters**: `token`
    - **Response**: `{ user_id, name, email, address }`

- **Restaurant APIs**:

  - `GET /restaurants?location={location}&cuisine={cuisine}&page={page}&limit={limit}` - Fetches paginated list of restaurants based on search filters.

    - **Parameters**: `location`, `cuisine`, `page`, `limit`
    - **Response**: `{ restaurants: [ { restaurant_id, name, rating, cuisine, location } ], total_pages }`

  - `GET /restaurant/{restaurant_id}` - Fetches details of a specific

restaurant, including its menu. - **Parameters**: `restaurant_id` - **Response**: `{ restaurantDetails, menu }`

- **Order APIs**:

  - `POST /order` - Places a new order.

    - **Parameters**: `{ user_id, restaurant_id, order_items, total_price, payment_info }`
    - **Response**: `{ order_id, status }`

  - `GET /orders?user_id={user_id}&page={page}&limit={limit}` - Fetches a list of user orders with pagination.
    - **Parameters**: `user_id`, `page`, `limit`
    - **Response**: `{ orders: [ { order_id, restaurant_id, total_price, status } ], total_pages }`

### **5. Optimizations and Deep Dive**

- **Performance**:

  - Use WebSockets for real-time order tracking and updates to minimize latency for delivery status.
  - Implement lazy loading for restaurant menus and large images to speed up page load times.

- **Scalability**:

  - Use horizontal scaling and load balancing to manage large numbers of simultaneous orders and user sessions.

- **Security**:

  - Secure payment gateways using **OAuth** and tokenization for sensitive payment information.
  - Ensure all API communications are encrypted using **HTTPS**.

- **Offline Mode**:
  - Implement basic offline functionality such as viewing previously placed orders and saved restaurants in the user's local storage.

### **Summary**

This front-end design for a food delivery platform like Uber Eats follows the **RADIO framework**, incorporating key components such as **Frontend Application (SPA)**, **Routing Module**, **State Management**, **UI Components**, **API Integration Layer**, and **Security Layer**. The **Data Model** specifies component ownership and sources, while the **API Definitions** include pagination, making it efficient for large datasets like restaurants and order histories. This system is designed to be scalable, secure, and high-performing, with support for real-time updates and a smooth user experience.
