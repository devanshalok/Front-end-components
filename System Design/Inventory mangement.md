### **Designing an Amazon Inventory Management Front-End System Using the RADIO Framework**

This system design focuses on building a **front-end inventory management system** for **Amazon** or similar large-scale e-commerce platforms. The system will allow warehouse managers, sellers, and administrators to track and manage inventory, monitor stock levels, reorder items, and manage products efficiently across multiple warehouses or fulfillment centers.

We will follow the **RADIO framework** to structure this design, ensuring it is **scalable**, **secure**, and capable of handling **real-time inventory updates**.

---

### **1. Requirements Exploration**

#### **Functional Requirements:**

- **Product Catalog Management:** Allow users (sellers or warehouse managers) to view and manage product listings, including adding new products, editing product details, and removing products.
- **Inventory Tracking:** Users can monitor the current stock levels of products across multiple warehouses or fulfillment centers.
- **Stock Alerts:** Automatically notify users when stock levels fall below a specified threshold.
- **Real-Time Stock Updates:** Users can update stock levels in real-time when new shipments arrive or when products are sold.
- **Warehouse Management:** Users can assign products to different warehouses or fulfillment centers and track stock across different locations.
- **Order Fulfillment Status:** Display fulfillment status of products that have been ordered but not yet shipped.
- **Product Search and Filtering:** Users can search and filter products by category, SKU, location, or stock status (in-stock, out-of-stock, low stock).
- **Reordering and Purchase Orders:** Automatically generate reorder requests for products that need restocking, including creating purchase orders for suppliers.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements:**

- **Performance:** Must handle large volumes of products and stock updates in real-time, without slowing down the user interface.
- **Scalability:** Must scale to manage millions of product SKUs, orders, and stock updates across multiple warehouses.
- **Security:** Ensure secure access to the system with proper authentication and access controls to protect sensitive inventory data.
- **Accessibility:** Provide features such as screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, and adherence to accessibility standards.
- **Offline Support:** Users should be able to view product data and manage stock levels even when offline (with data syncing when back online).

### **Explanation of Components:**

1. **Frontend Application (SPA)**:

   - **View: Product List**: Displays all the products in the inventory, including SKU, description, stock levels, price, and product categories. Users can search, filter, edit, or view detailed information about each product.
   - **View: Warehouse Stock**: Shows the stock levels of products across multiple warehouse locations. This view allows users to track which warehouse holds which stock, and users can transfer stock between warehouses.
   - **Routing Module**: Manages navigation between different parts of the system, such as product lists, warehouse views, and order tracking, using **React Router** or **Vue Router**.
   - **State Management**: Manages global state, such as the current list of products, stock updates, and thresholds, using **Redux** or **Context API**. It ensures that product and stock information is always up to date in the user interface.
   - **API Integration Layer**: Connects with backend services for retrieving product data, warehouse stock, and order fulfillment status using **Axios** or **Fetch API**. It also sends stock update requests in real-time to the backend.
   - **UI Components**: Reusable UI components like product tables, stock levels, threshold alerts, and warehouse lists.
   - **Security Layer**: Ensures secure user access and role-based permissions using **JWT tokens**, **HTTPS**, and **role-based access control**. Users such as warehouse managers, sellers, and administrators will have different levels of access to the system.
   - **Caching Layer**: Uses **SWR** or **IndexedDB** to cache product data, stock levels, and warehouse information for faster access and offline support.

2. **Inventory Controller**:

   - Manages user interactions related to inventory updates, such as updating product stock levels, reordering items, transferring stock between warehouses, and adjusting product information. It also generates notifications when stock levels fall below thresholds and handles bulk updates (e.g., for incoming shipments).

3. **Stock State Management**:

   - Tracks the state of the inventory, including product stock levels across different locations, warehouse assignments, and the current status of each item (e.g., in stock, low stock, out of stock). It also tracks any automatic or manual stock adjustments.

4. **Backend Services**:
   - **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization using **OAuth** to ensure secure logins and access control.
   - **Inventory Service**: Provides APIs for managing the product catalog, including product details, SKUs, warehouse locations, and stock levels. It allows users to update, search, and filter inventory data.
   - **Stock Update Service**: Handles real-time updates of stock levels, including receiving notifications when stock is low, processing incoming shipments, and triggering reorders when necessary.

---

### **3. Data Model**

```typescript
The data model defines key entities related to users, products, warehouses, and stock updates. Each entity is linked to specific components and their sources:

// Product Entity to represent items in inventory
type Product = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  sku: string;  // Stock Keeping Unit
  price: number;
  quantity_in_stock: number;  // Current stock level
  reorder_level: number;  // Threshold for when stock should be reordered
  supplier_id: number;  // Links to the supplier providing the product
  photo_url?: string;  // Optional photo of the product
};

// Supplier Entity to represent suppliers for products
type Supplier = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  contact_info: string;  // Phone, email, etc.
  address: string;  // Supplier location
};

// Inventory Transaction Type for tracking stock movement
type InventoryTransaction = {
  id: number;
  product_id: number;
  transaction_type: 'INCOMING' | 'OUTGOING';  // Whether stock was added or removed
  quantity: number;  // Quantity of the product involved in the transaction
  transaction_date: string;  // Timestamp of the transaction
  supplier_id?: number;  // Optional, only relevant for incoming transactions
};

// Typeahead Search Request Type for finding products or suppliers
type SearchRequest = {
  searchQuery: string;
  start_from: number;
  limit: number;
};

// Search Result Type with Pagination for Products and Suppliers
type SearchResult<T extends Entity> = {
  data: T[]; // Could be products or suppliers
  pagination: {
    start_from: number;
    limit: number;
    total: number;
  };
};

// Client State for Managing Current Inventory Status
type ClientState = {
  searchQuery: string;
  searchResults: SearchResult<Entity>; // Holds current search results for products/suppliers
  recentQueries: string[];  // Cached search queries
  inventoryTransactions: InventoryTransaction[];  // Current list of transactions
};
```

### **4. Interface Definition (API)**

Below are the **API definitions** for the inventory management system, including pagination for handling large sets of products and stock data.

- **User APIs**:

  - `POST /login` - Authenticates the user using OAuth.
    - **Parameters**: `{ email, password }`
    - **Response**: `{ token, userDetails }`

- **Product APIs**:

  - `GET /products?page={page}&limit={limit}` - Fetches a paginated list of products in the inventory.

    - **Parameters**: `page`, `limit`
    - **Response**: `{ products: [ { product_id, name, sku, current_stock } ], total_pages }`

  - `POST /product/update` - Updates product details or stock levels.
    - **Parameters**: `{ product_id, name, price, current_stock, threshold }`
    - **Response**: `{ status, updated_product }`

- **Warehouse APIs**:

  - `GET /warehouse/{warehouse_id}/stock` - Fetches stock levels for all products in a specific warehouse.

    - **Parameters**: `warehouse_id`
    - **Response**: `{ products: [ { product_id, name, current_stock, location } ] }`

  - `POST /stock/update` - Updates stock levels for a product in a warehouse (incoming or outgoing stock).
    - **Parameters**: `{ product_id, warehouse_id, quantity, update_type }`
    - **Response**: `{ status, stock_update_id }`

---

### **5. Optimizations and Deep Dive**

- **Performance**:

  - Use **lazy loading** to load products and stock data as the user scrolls through large inventories.
  - Implement **WebSocket connections** for real-time stock updates to reflect changes instantly when products are moved between warehouses or sold.

- **Scalability**:

  - Use **geo-based distributed databases** for managing product inventory data across multiple regions, ensuring fast access for users in different locations.
  - Employ **horizontal scaling** for backend services to manage the large volume of stock updates and order management for millions of products.

- **Security**:

  - Use **role-based access control (RBAC)** to restrict access to certain areas of the system based on user roles (e.g., warehouse manager, seller, administrator).
  - Implement **JWT tokens** for secure session management and use **SSL/TLS** for all data transfers.

- **Offline Mode**:
  - Implement offline functionality using **IndexedDB** to store inventory data locally, allowing users to manage stock levels and view product data even when offline. Changes are synced back to the server when the user reconnects to the internet.
