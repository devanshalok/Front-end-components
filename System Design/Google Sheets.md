### **Designing a Google Sheets-like Front-End System Using the RADIO Framework**

This system design will focus on creating the **front-end system** of a **Google Sheets-like** web-based spreadsheet application. It will allow users to create and manage spreadsheets, input data into cells, perform calculations, use formulas, and collaborate with others in real-time. Google Sheets also supports features like cell formatting, charts, and collaboration, which will be included in the design.

We will follow the **RADIO framework** to structure this design, making it **scalable**, **collaborative**, and **performant**.

---

### **1. Requirements Exploration**

#### **Functional Requirements:**

- **Spreadsheet Creation:** Users can create, rename, and delete spreadsheets.
- **Sheet Navigation:** Users can navigate between multiple sheets within a spreadsheet.
- **Cell Input and Formatting:** Users can input data into cells, format text (bold, italic, colors), and apply number formats (currency, percentage).
- **Formulas and Calculations:** Users can use common spreadsheet functions (SUM, AVERAGE, IF, etc.) and perform calculations in cells.
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Multiple users can work on the same spreadsheet simultaneously, seeing each otherâ€™s changes in real-time.
- **Cell History and Undo/Redo:** Track changes to cells and provide undo/redo functionality.
- **Data Visualization:** Users can create charts (bar, pie, line) based on spreadsheet data.
- **Search and Filtering:** Users can search for specific data within the sheet and apply filters to columns.
- **Offline Mode:** Users can view and edit spreadsheets even when offline, with changes syncing once they reconnect.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements:**

- **Performance:** Must handle large datasets and complex formulas without performance degradation.
- **Scalability:** The system must support large-scale real-time collaboration with many simultaneous users.
- **Security:** Ensure user data and collaboration are secured with end-to-end encryption and proper access control.
- **Accessibility:** The system should be compliant with accessibility standards for screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- **Extensibility:** The front-end should be easily extensible to support new features and plugins (e.g., custom functions, macros).

### **Explanation of Components:**

1. **Frontend Application (SPA)**:

   - **View: Spreadsheet (Grid)**: This component renders a grid of cells that users can interact with. It supports scrolling, selection of cells, and basic navigation (moving between sheets or within a spreadsheet).
   - **View: Cell Editor**: This component allows users to edit individual cell content, including entering text, numbers, formulas, and applying formatting.
   - **Routing Module**: Manages navigation between different parts of the application, such as switching between sheets, spreadsheet files, or views like charts and dashboards. It can be implemented using **React Router** or **Vue Router**.
   - **State Management**: Manages the global state of the spreadsheet, such as the current sheet, cell selection, formulas, and collaborative changes, using **Redux** or **Context API**.
   - **API Integration Layer**: Connects the front-end with backend services to load, save, and sync spreadsheets, as well as manage real-time collaboration using **WebSocket**, **GraphQL**, or **REST APIs**.
   - **UI Components**: Reusable components like the spreadsheet grid, toolbars (for formatting options, formulas), and charting components for data visualization.
   - **Security Layer**: Ensures secure communication and access control using **SSL/TLS** for data transfer and **OAuth** for authentication and authorization.
   - **Caching Layer**: Uses **SWR** (stale-while-revalidate) or **IndexedDB** for offline support and caching, allowing users to access their spreadsheets when offline and sync changes once online.

2. **Spreadsheet Controller**:

   - The controller manages the user interactions with the spreadsheet grid, such as inputting data, applying formulas, formatting cells, and managing real-time updates with the collaboration layer.

3. **Cell State Management**:

   - Manages the state of individual cells, including their values, formatting, and formulas. It also handles undo/redo functionality, change history, and tracks collaboration changes when multiple users are editing the same spreadsheet.

4. **Backend Services**:
   - **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and session management using **OAuth** for services like Google, Microsoft, etc.
   - **Spreadsheet Data Service**: Provides APIs to load, save, and sync spreadsheet data with the backend. It ensures data persistence and handles complex calculations server-side if needed.
   - **Collaboration Service**: Manages real-time collaboration, using **WebSockets** or **WebRTC** for live updates, including real-time conflict resolution mechanisms like **Operational Transformation (OT)** or **CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types)**.

---

### **3. Data Model**

The data model defines key entities related to spreadsheets, cells, and user accounts. Each entity is linked to specific components and their sources:

- **User Entity**:

  - **Fields**: `user_id`, `name`, `email`, `profile_picture`, `spreadsheets[]`, `last_login`
  - **Component**: Authentication Service, Client Store
  - **Source**: OAuth, User Service API

- **Spreadsheet Entity**:

  - **Fields**: `spreadsheet_id`, `user_id`, `name`, `sheets[]`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
  - **Component**: Spreadsheet View, API Integration Layer, State Management
  - **Source**: Backend Database, Spreadsheet Data Service

- **Sheet Entity**:

  - **Fields**: `sheet_id`, `spreadsheet_id`, `name`, `cells[]`
  - **Component**: Spreadsheet Grid, Cell State Management
  - **Source**: Backend Database, Spreadsheet Data Service

- **Cell Entity**:
  - **Fields**: `cell_id`, `sheet_id`, `value`, `formula`, `formatting` (e.g., bold, italic, currency), `last_updated`
  - **Component**: Cell Editor, State Management
  - **Source**: Backend Database, Spreadsheet Data Service

---

### \*\*4. Interface Definition (API

)\*\*

Below are the **API definitions** for interacting with the spreadsheet service, including pagination where necessary for loading large datasets:

- **User APIs**:

  - `POST /login` - Authenticates the user using OAuth.
    - **Parameters**: `{ provider, email, password }`
    - **Response**: `{ token, userDetails }`

- **Spreadsheet APIs**:

  - `GET /spreadsheets?user_id={user_id}&page={page}&limit={limit}` - Fetches paginated spreadsheets for a user.

    - **Parameters**: `user_id`, `page`, `limit`
    - **Response**: `{ spreadsheets: [ { spreadsheet_id, name, updated_at } ], total_pages }`

  - `GET /spreadsheet/{spreadsheet_id}` - Loads a specific spreadsheet with all its sheets.

    - **Parameters**: `spreadsheet_id`
    - **Response**: `{ spreadsheet_id, sheets[] }`

  - `POST /spreadsheet/save` - Saves changes made to the spreadsheet.
    - **Parameters**: `{ spreadsheet_id, sheets[] }`
    - **Response**: `{ status, spreadsheet_id }`

- **Cell APIs**:

  - `POST /cell/update` - Updates a specific cellâ€™s value or formula.
    - **Parameters**: `{ cell_id, value, formula }`
    - **Response**: `{ status, cell_id }`

- **Collaboration APIs**:
  - `POST /collaboration/sync` - Syncs real-time changes made by multiple collaborators.
    - **Parameters**: `{ spreadsheet_id, cell_updates[] }`
    - **Response**: `{ status, synced_version }`

---

### **5. Optimizations and Deep Dive**

- **Performance**:
  - Use **virtual DOM** for efficiently rendering the spreadsheet grid, especially for large datasets.
  - Implement **lazy loading** for cell data to optimize the performance of large spreadsheets.
- **Scalability**:
  - Use **WebSockets** for real-time collaboration to ensure low-latency syncing between collaborators.
  - Employ **differential synchronization** to only send changes (deltas) instead of the entire spreadsheet on every update.
- **Security**:

  - Use **OAuth** for secure authentication and access to user data.
  - Ensure all communication with the backend services is encrypted using **SSL/TLS**, and protect spreadsheets with proper access control lists (ACLs) for shared spreadsheets.

- **Offline Mode**:
  - Implement **IndexedDB** to store spreadsheets and changes locally, allowing users to work offline. The system should automatically sync with the backend once the user reconnects to the internet.
