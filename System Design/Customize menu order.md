### **Explanation of Components:**

1. **Frontend Application (SPA)**:

   - **View: Restaurant List**: Displays a searchable and filterable list of restaurants. Users can filter by cuisine, ratings, location, or popularity. Clicking on a restaurant leads to its menu page.
   - **View: Menu and Customization Options**: Shows the menu of a restaurant with available dishes. Users can customize their orders (e.g., add toppings, adjust portion sizes). The price adjusts based on customizations.
   - **Routing Module**: Manages navigation between different views, such as the restaurant list, menus, cart, and checkout using **React Router** or **Vue Router**.
   - **State Management**: Manages the app’s global state, including the user’s selected items, customizations, cart, and order status using **Redux** or **Context API**.
   - **API Integration Layer**: Connects with backend services for fetching restaurant and menu data, placing orders, and handling payments via **Axios** or **Fetch API**.
   - **UI Components**: Reusable components like restaurant cards, menus, customization modals, and cart summaries.
   - **Security Layer**: Ensures secure transactions and data handling using **HTTPS**, **JWT tokens** for user authentication, and encryption for sensitive data like payment information.
   - **Caching Layer**: Uses **SWR** or **IndexedDB** to cache restaurant data, menus, and user orders for fast performance and offline access.

2. **Restaurant Controller**:

   - Manages user interactions related to restaurant selection, menu viewing, and food customization. It interacts with the **API Integration Layer** to fetch restaurant and menu details and passes that data to the **UI Components** for rendering.

3. **Order State Management**:

   - Manages the state of the user’s current order, including selected items, customizations, cart contents, and total price. It tracks the order through the customization process, ensuring the correct items are added and the total is updated accordingly.

4. **Backend Services**:
   - **Authentication Service**: Manages user sign-ups, logins, and sessions using **OAuth** for secure authentication.
   - **Restaurant and Menu Service**: Manages the storage and retrieval of restaurant data, menus, and available customizations. It supports dynamic updates to menus (e.g., adding new items or modifying availability).
   - **Order Service**: Handles order placements, updates, and order status tracking (e.g., in preparation, out for delivery).

    - **Parameters**: `location`, `cuisine`, `page`, `limit`
    - **Response**: `{ restaurants: [ { restaurant_id, name, cuisine_type, rating } ], total_pages }`

  - `GET /restaurant/{restaurant_id}/menu` - Fetches the menu of a specific restaurant.
    - **Parameters**: `restaurant_id`
    - **Response**: `{ menu: [ { menu_item_id, name, description, price, customizations[] } ] }`

- **Order APIs**:

  - `POST /order/create` - Places a new order.

    - **Parameters**: `{ user_id, restaurant_id, items[], total_price }`
    - **Response**: `{ order_id, status }`

  - `GET /order/{order_id}/status` - Fetches the status of an existing order.
    - **Parameters**: `order_id`
    - **Response**: `{ order_id, status, estimated_delivery_time }`

### **5. Optimizations and Deep Dive**

- **Performance**:

  - Use **lazy loading** for restaurant and menu items to reduce the initial load time when displaying a large number of restaurants or dishes.
  - Implement **caching** with **IndexedDB** for previously viewed restaurants and menus, enabling faster access and offline support.

- **Scalability**:

  - Use **horizontal scaling** for backend services to handle high volumes of traffic during peak meal times.
  - Implement **distributed databases** to manage restaurant and menu data across regions, ensuring faster data access for users in different locations.

- **Security**:

  - Secure user data with **OAuth** for authentication and **JWT** for session management.
  - Use **HTTPS** for all communication between the client and server, and ensure **encryption** of sensitive data like payment information.

- **Offline Mode**:
  - Implement offline functionality using **IndexedDB** to store visited restaurants and menu data locally, allowing users to browse menus and build orders even without an internet connection.
