1. **Frontend Application (SPA)**:

   - **View: Video Grid**: Displays video feeds of all participants in a grid format, with real-time audio and video controls for each participant.
   - **View: Chat Window**: Allows participants to send and receive text messages during the meeting. Chat history is visible in this view, and users can toggle between the video and chat views.
   - **Routing Module**: Manages navigation between different parts of the application, such as joining a meeting, viewing the chat, and changing settings using **React Router** or **Vue Router**.
   - **State Management**: Handles global state, such as participants' streams, chat history, and connection statuses, using **Redux** or **Context API**. This manages things like user muting/unmuting, video feed toggles, and active speakers.
   - **API Integration Layer**: Connects with backend services to handle video streaming via **WebRTC**, manage chat messages, handle screen sharing, and record meetings.
   - **UI Components**: Reusable UI components such as video player controls, participant lists, chat boxes, and gallery views. These components provide the interactive interface for the user.
   - **Security Layer**: Implements encryption protocols using **SSL/TLS** for data in transit and **end-to-end encryption** (E2EE) for video and audio streams, ensuring that data is protected.
   - **Caching Layer**: Uses **SWR** or **localStorage** to cache meeting settings, participant names, and chat history, improving performance and allowing users to reconnect quickly in case of network issues.

2. **Video Conferencing Controller**:

   - Handles user interactions with the video and audio streams, such as starting/stopping video, muting/unmuting audio, and screen sharing. It also manages the gallery view and controls access to features like chat and recording.

3. **Stream State Management**:

   - Manages the state of participants' video and audio streams, including their connection status, mute status, and video feed resolution. It also tracks network quality to adapt video quality accordingly.

4. **Backend Services**:
   - **Authentication Service**: Manages user authentication and session management using **OAuth** for secure logins.
   - **Video Stream Service**: Facilitates video and audio transmission using **WebRTC** and a **Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU)** to optimize the distribution of streams. SFU allows efficient one-to-many communication, where media is relayed without being processed.
   - **Chat and Recording Service**: Manages chat messages sent during the meeting and handles meeting recordings. It ensures that chat and recorded data are stored securely and are accessible only to authorized participants.

    - **Parameters**: `meeting_id`, `page`, `limit`
    - **Response**: `{ messages: [ { message_id, sender_id, message_text, timestamp } ], total_pages }`

- **Recording APIs**:

  - `POST /recording/start` - Starts recording the meeting.

    - **Parameters**: `{ meeting_id, user_id }`
    - **Response**: `{ recording_id, status }`

  - `POST /recording/stop` - Stops recording the meeting.
    - **Parameters**: `{ recording_id, user_id }`
    - **Response**: `{ status }`

### **5. Optimizations and Deep Dive**

- **Performance**:

  - Use **adaptive video quality** based on network conditions, where the video stream resolution can change dynamically to reduce bandwidth usage on slow networks.
  - Implement **server-side recording** for meetings to offload processing from the client-side, allowing seamless performance on user devices.

- **Scalability**:

  - Use **Selective Forwarding Units (SFUs)** for video stream handling. SFUs efficiently forward streams from each participant without encoding them, allowing the platform to scale to large meetings with many participants.
  - Employ **horizontal scaling** for chat and meeting management services to support a large number of concurrent meetings and participants.

- **Security**:

  - Implement **end-to-end encryption (E2EE)** for video, audio, and chat streams to prevent unauthorized interception or tampering of media data.
  - Use **OAuth 2.0** for secure user authentication and session management, ensuring users can only join meetings they are authorized for.

- **Offline Mode**:
  - Use **local caching** of chat messages and settings using **localStorage** or **IndexedDB** so that users can maintain their settings and rejoin meetings seamlessly after a disconnection.
