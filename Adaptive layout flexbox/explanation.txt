Implementation Steps
HTML: Use semantic elements for structure and accessibility.
CSS: Use Flexbox for layout responsiveness and styling.
Accessibility: Add roles, labels, and semantic elements to improve accessibility.

Key Features of the Layout

HTML Structure:
Uses semantic elements (<header>, <main>, <article>, <aside>, <footer>) to ensure the layout is meaningful and accessible to assistive technologies.
Links in the navigation are styled as buttons with role="button" to enhance accessibility, making it clearer to screen readers that these are interactive elements.

Flexbox Layout:
The main content and sidebar use Flexbox with flex: 1 1 properties, allowing them to grow and shrink based on the available space and screen size.
Flexbox properties like flex-wrap: wrap and gap ensure that the layout adapts well to different screen sizes.

Accessibility Enhancements:
aria-label and aria-labelledby are used to describe navigation and content areas, providing additional context for screen readers.
The use of headings (<h1>, <h2>) with id attributes connected to aria-labelledby makes navigating through content easier for those using assistive technologies.

Responsive Design:
Media queries are used to adjust the layout when the screen width is 768px or less, stacking the sidebar below the main content for a better mobile experience.
The layout ensures the content remains readable and well-structured regardless of the device used.
