Implementation Steps
HTML: Create the structure with a search input field and a list of items.
CSS: Style the search bar and the list of items.
JavaScript: Add functionality to filter the list based on the search input.

Explanation

HTML:
The structure includes a search input (<input>) and an unordered list (<ul>) with list items (<li>) that represent the data being searched.
Each list item is a potential match for the search query.

CSS:
Styles the search bar for a clean, simple appearance.
The list items are styled with padding, borders, and hover effects to improve usability.

JavaScript:
The input event listener on the search bar captures user input and filters the list of items.
The textContent of each list item is checked against the user's input.
If the search term matches an item's text, that item is displayed; otherwise, it's hidden.
If no items match, a "No results found" message is displayed below the list.

How It Works
Typing in the Search Bar: As you type, the JavaScript code dynamically filters the list to show only the items that match the entered text.
Responsive Feedback: The list updates instantly, providing immediate feedback on which items match the query.
No Results Handling: If no items match the search term, a "No results found" message is displayed.
