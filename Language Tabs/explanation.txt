Implementation Steps:

HTML Structure:
Create tabs for each language.
Create a content area that changes based on the selected tab.

CSS:
Style the tabs and the active tab.
Style the content area.

JavaScript:
Fetch data from the API.
Display content based on the selected tab.
Highlight the active tab

Key Features of the Code:

Dynamic Tabs: The tabs are created based on the data received from the API.
Active Tab Highlighting: The clicked tab is highlighted with a different background color, and the corresponding content is displayed.
Content Update: Clicking on a tab updates the content area to show the relevant text.

How to Use:
Replace the apiData array with the actual data fetched from the API endpoint.
The code assumes that the endpoint provides data in a structured format. If the format is different, adjust the data handling logic accordingly.
