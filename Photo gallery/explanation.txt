Implementation Overview
HTML: Add an input field and a button for uploading new photos.
CSS: Style the input and button for adding new images.
JavaScript: Handle the file upload, create a new gallery item, and enable lightbox functionality for the newly added image.


Explanation:

HTML Structure:
An input field and a button have been added to upload new images to the gallery.
The gallery is displayed using a grid layout. Each new image added will have lightbox functionality, similar to the initial images.

CSS Styling:
Styled the input and button to align well with the gallery layout.
Lightbox and gallery styles remain consistent with the initial design.

JavaScript Functionality:
When the "Add Photo" button is clicked, it checks if a file is selected and reads the image using FileReader.
The image is then added to the gallery with the lightbox feature enabled.
A counter is used to assign unique IDs to each new lightbox section, ensuring that each lightbox is individually targetable.

Usage
Click on the "Choose File" button to select an image from your computer.
Click "Add Photo" to add the selected image to the gallery.
Click on the image in the gallery to view it in a larger size with the lightbox feature.
