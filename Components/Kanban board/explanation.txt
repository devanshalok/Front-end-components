Implementation Steps
HTML: Add an input field and a button for task creation.
CSS: Style the input field and button for a better user interface.
JavaScript: Implement the functionality to add new tasks to the "To Do" column and ensure that new tasks are draggable and can be moved between columns.

Explanation

HTML Structure:
A new input field and button are added above the board to allow the user to enter new tasks.
The Kanban board remains the same with three columns: "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."

CSS Styling:
Added styles for the task input and the add button to make them look integrated with the board design.

JavaScript Functionality:
Adding Tasks: The addTaskButton event listener calls createTaskElement when clicked, adding a new task to the "To Do" column.
Creating Task Elements: The createTaskElement function creates a new task, makes it draggable, and appends it to the designated drop zone.
Drag-and-Drop: The existing drag-and-drop logic handles moving tasks between columns.

Usage
Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add Task" button to create a new task in the "To Do" column.
Drag and drop tasks between the columns to update their status.
