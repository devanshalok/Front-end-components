Explanation

HTML Structure:
The HTML consists of a simple div element with the class clock and an ID of clock, which is used to display the current time.

CSS Styling:
The body is styled to center the clock vertically and horizontally on the page.
The clock has a large font size, a border, padding, and a box shadow to give it a stylish, digital look.
The color scheme uses a dark background with a light blue text color for a modern digital clock appearance.

JavaScript Functionality:
The updateClock function gets the current time using JavaScriptâ€™s Date object.
The hours, minutes, and seconds are extracted and padded with leading zeros if necessary to ensure two-digit formatting.
The function updates the clock every second using setInterval.

Responsive and Dynamic:
The clock updates dynamically every second, ensuring that the displayed time is always accurate.
