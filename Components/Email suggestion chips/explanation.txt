Implementation Steps
HTML: Set up the input field and the container for chips.
CSS: Style the input, chips, and auto-suggest dropdown.
JavaScript: Implement the logic to suggest contacts, create chips, and handle chip deletions.

Explanation
HTML Structure:
A main input field inside a container is used to type emails. The suggestion-box element shows the auto-suggested
contacts.

CSS:
Styles the input, chips, and suggestion box to make them look appealing and user-friendly.

JavaScript:
Auto-Suggest: The input event on the main input field listens for changes, filters contacts, and displays matching
suggestions.

Creating Chips: When a suggestion is clicked, it adds the contact to the selectedContacts array and creates a chip
showing the contacts name and avatar.
Removing Chips: The chips have a close button (×) that removes the chip when clicked, updating the selected contacts.

Usage
Start typing in the input field to see suggestions based on the contact list.
Click on a suggestion to create a chip.
Click the close (×) icon on a chip to remove it.
