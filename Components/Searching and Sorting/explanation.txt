Implementation Steps
HTML: Create the basic structure of the table and input for search.
CSS: Style the table, headers, and search input.
JavaScript: Handle populating the table, sorting the data, and filtering based on user input.

Explanation

HTML:
The table structure includes headers (<th>) for each column: Name, Age, and City.
Each header has data-column and data-order attributes to track the column being sorted and the sort order.

CSS:
The table and search input are styled for a clean look.
Arrow indicators (▲ for ascending and ▼ for descending) are added to the headers when they are clicked for sorting.

JavaScript:
The renderTableRows function populates the table rows based on the data.
The sortTable function sorts the data array based on the clicked column and the specified order (ascending or descending).
The filterTable function filters the data based on the search term entered in the input field.
Event listeners are added to the headers to handle sorting and to the search input for filtering.

Features
Sorting: Click on the column headers to sort the table data in ascending or descending order.
Searching: Enter text in the search input to filter the rows based on the entered term.
Dynamic: The table updates in real-time as you type in the search input or click the headers.
