To implement a component that fetches birth year data from an API and draws a histogram, we can follow these steps:

Fetch Data from API: We'll fetch birth year data from a sample API.
Parse the Data: Extract and process the birth year information from the API response.
Draw Histogram: Use a library like Chart.js to visualize the histogram of birth years.
Steps:
HTML for the Histogram: Create a canvas where the chart will be drawn.
Fetch Data from API: Fetch the birth years from a sample API.
Process Data: Parse the birth years and count their occurrences.
Draw the Histogram: Use Chart.js to draw the histogram based on the fetched and processed data.
We'll use a working sample API from RandomUser.me, which generates random user data, including birth year information.

Explanation:

HTML Structure:
A <canvas> element is used to render the histogram using Chart.js.
A loading message is displayed while the data is being fetched from the API.

CSS Styling:
The histogram is centered on the page, with the canvas sized to fit the container.
The loading message appears until the data is fetched and the chart is drawn.

JavaScript Logic:
Fetch Data from API: The fetchUserData() function uses the fetch() API to get 100 random users from https://randomuser.me/api/?results=100. Each user contains birth date information, which we extract and convert into birth years.
Process Birth Years: The birth years are stored in an array (birthYears), and we count the occurrences of each birth year using the reduce() method to create a frequency count.
Draw Histogram: We use Chart.js to draw a bar chart. The x-axis represents the birth years, and the y-axis represents the number of people born in each year.

Using Chart.js:
Data Labels: The labels array contains the unique sorted birth years.
Data Values: The data array contains the count of people born in each corresponding year.
The chart options configure the scales and axes, setting the x-axis label to "Birth Year" and the y-axis label to "Frequency".
