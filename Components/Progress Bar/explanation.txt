To implement a progress bar that fills up as a user fills out a form, we'll combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The idea is simple: as the user fills in each required field in the form, the progress bar will incrementally fill up. We'll assume that each field contributes equally to the progress.

Features:
Form Fields: The form will contain multiple fields (e.g., name, email, etc.).
Progress Bar: The progress bar will visually indicate the completion percentage of the form.
Real-Time Updates: As the user fills in each field, the progress bar will update in real-time.

Explanation:

HTML Structure:
The form consists of four input fields: Name, Email, Age, and Phone.
Each field has a required attribute to ensure that the user needs to fill them out.
A progress bar (#progress-bar) is placed at the top of the form to visually display the progress.

CSS Styling:
The progress bar is styled to show a blue fill that increases as the form is filled out.
The form has a clean and simple design, with each input field and button styled for a good user experience.

JavaScript Functionality:
The form.addEventListener('input', updateProgress) listens for any input changes in the form fields and calls the updateProgress function.
updateProgress Function:
It counts how many fields have been filled out.
The progress is calculated as the percentage of filled fields out of the total number of fields.
The progress bar's width is updated dynamically based on the number of filled fields, and the percentage is displayed inside the progress bar.

Real-Time Progress:
As the user types into the input fields, the progress bar updates in real-time.
When all fields are filled, the progress bar will show 100%.
