To implement a calendar where you can select a month and year from dropdowns and display the corresponding days for the selected month, we can break it down into the following components:

Month dropdown: Displays all 12 months.
Year dropdown: Displays a range of years.
Days grid: Dynamically updates based on the selected month and year.
Selection of days: Users can click to select any days

Explanation:

Dropdown for Months and Years:
The monthDropdown and yearDropdown are populated with months (January to December) and a range of years (current year Â± 20 years).
The current month and year are preselected based on today's date.

Dynamic Day Rendering:
The renderCalendar function dynamically calculates the number of days in the selected month and year using getDaysInMonth().
Days are displayed in a grid layout. Each day is clickable, allowing users to select it. When a day is clicked, it is visually highlighted.

Grid Layout for Days:
The days are displayed in a grid with 7 columns, representing the days of the week.
The days are generated and displayed based on the number of days in the selected month and year.

CSS for Styling:
The layout and design are kept simple with a days-grid displaying the days in a visually appealing manner.
Days change color when hovered over and when selected.

To add a proper calendar with the days of the week (Monday to Sunday) and dynamically adjust the days to start on the correct weekday based on the selected month and year, we can modify the code to:
Add a header for days of the week (Monday to Sunday).
Adjust the starting day of the month based on the selected month and year.

Days of the Week Header:
Added a header showing the names of the days from Monday to Sunday using the weekDays array. This is rendered as the first row in the calendar grid.

Day Alignment:
The getStartDayOfMonth function calculates which day of the week the 1st of the selected month falls on. It adjusts so that Monday is considered the first day of the week.
Empty divs (.empty) are added to the grid for any days before the 1st of the month to align the starting day of the month correctly.

Days Grid:
The grid now has 7 columns (for the 7 days of the week).
Clicking a day will highlight it by adding the selected class, and the previously selected day is deselected.

How the Logic Works:
The calendar dynamically updates when the user selects a different month or year.
The number of days displayed is calculated using getDaysInMonth, and the correct starting day is determined using getStartDayOfMonth to position the days of the month properly.
The grid is flexible and adjusts based on the month and year combination.
