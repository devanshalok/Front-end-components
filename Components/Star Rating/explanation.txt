Implementation
HTML: Define the stars and their structure.
CSS: Style the stars for normal, hover, and selected states.
JavaScript: Add interactivity to handle hover, click, and rating state management.

Explanation

HTML:
A div with the class star-rating contains five star elements (span) with the class star.
Each star has a data-value attribute representing its position (1 to 5).

CSS:
Stars are styled with default gray color (#ccc).
When hovered, stars change color to yellow (#ffcc00) to indicate selection.
The selected class is applied to indicate the clicked stars.

JavaScript:
Hover Behavior: When hovering over a star, all previous stars are highlighted up to the hovered star.
Click Behavior: Clicking a star sets the current rating and highlights stars up to the clicked star.
Reset on Mouse Out: Stars return to their current rating state when the mouse is moved away.

How It Works
Hovering over a star shows the tentative rating up to that star.
Clicking locks the rating in place, applying the selected class to all stars up to the clicked star.
The rating is displayed or logged as per your requirements, and you can extend this to submit the rating to a server.

JavaScript Adjustments:

The hover event now highlights only the stars up to the hovered star by directly passing the star element to the handleHover function.
The highlightStars function checks each star's index against the passed rating value, ensuring only the appropriate stars are highlighted.
CSS Update:

Removed the CSS sibling selectors that were previously used to highlight stars, shifting the logic entirely to JavaScript to maintain fine control over the behavior.
How It Works
When the user hovers over a star, only the stars up to that specific star are highlighted.
Clicking a star sets the rating and highlights the stars up to the selected rating.
Moving the mouse away resets the stars to reflect the current rating state.
