Rendering text on a banner image can be achieved using HTML and CSS. The common approach is to position the text over
the image using CSS properties like position: relative and position: absolute. This allows the text to be placed
precisely on top of the image without affecting the flow of the document.

Explanation of the Code

HTML Structure:
A <div> with the class banner-container acts as the parent container that holds the image and the text.
The <img> tag with the class banner-image is used to display the banner image.
The <div> with the class banner-text contains the text that will be displayed on top of the image.

CSS Styling:
The .banner-container is set to position: relative, making it the positioning context for the absolutely
positioned text.
The .banner-image fills the width of its container and maintains its aspect ratio with width: 100%; height:
auto;.
The .banner-text uses position: absolute to overlay the text on top of the image.
top: 50%; left: 50% places the text roughly in the center of the container.
transform: translate(-50%, -50%) fine-tunes the position to be exactly centered.
The text styling includes white color, bold font, and a shadow to improve readability against the image.

Text Readability:
The text-shadow property is used to add a subtle shadow behind the text, enhancing contrast and ensuring the
text remains legible against various backgrounds.
