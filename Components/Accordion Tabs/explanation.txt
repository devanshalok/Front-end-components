Implementation:
HTML: Define the structure of the accordion with headers and content sections.
CSS: Style the accordion to show and hide content when expanded or collapsed.
JavaScript: Add functionality to toggle the visibility of each section when clicked.

Explanation:

HTML:
The accordion is structured with .accordion-item elements, each containing a .accordion-header and a .accordion-content.
The header is clickable, and the content is hidden by default.

CSS:
The .accordion-header is styled with a hover effect and an arrow indicating its state.
The .accordion-content is hidden by setting max-height: 0 and expanded when max-height is adjusted.

JavaScript:
JavaScript adds click event listeners to each header.
When clicked, the corresponding content toggles between expanded and collapsed states.
Only one section can be expanded at a time; if another is open, it collapses before the new section expands.
