Implementation
HTML: Create the structure for the carousel with images and navigation buttons.
CSS: Style the carousel, images, and navigation buttons.
JavaScript: Add functionality to navigate between images.

Explanation:

HTML:
The carousel is structured with a .carousel container holding the .carousel-images element, which contains individual .carousel-image elements for each slide.
Two buttons (prevButton and nextButton) are used for navigation.

CSS:
The .carousel has relative positioning with overflow hidden to show only one image at a time.
The .carousel-images uses flex display to align images side by side and transitions to slide between images smoothly.
Navigation buttons are styled and positioned at the sides of the carousel.

JavaScript:
The showSlide function updates the transform property of .carousel-images to show the current slide based on currentIndex.
Event listeners are attached to the buttons to navigate to the next or previous slide.
An optional setInterval auto-slides through the images every 5 seconds.
