Implementation Steps
HTML: Create the structure for the input field, button, and the list of tasks.
CSS: Style the to-do list for a clean and user-friendly interface.
JavaScript: Implement the functionality to add, mark, and remove tasks.

Explanation

HTML Structure:
The main container includes an input field, an "Add" button, and an unordered list (<ul>) where tasks will be displayed.

CSS Styling:
The styles create a simple and clean interface for the to-do list, with hover effects and basic transitions for interactions.

JavaScript Functionality:
Adding Tasks: When the user enters a task and clicks "Add" or presses Enter, the task is added to the list.
Marking as Completed: Clicking on a task toggles its completion state, visually represented by striking through the text and changing the background color.
Deleting Tasks: Each task has a delete button (×) that removes the task from the list when clicked.

Usage
Type a task into the input field and click "Add" or press Enter to add it to the list.
Click on a task to mark it as completed or uncompleted.
Click the delete button (×) on a task to remove it from the list.
