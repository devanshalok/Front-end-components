To implement a user database with Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities along with the ability to filter users, we can use JavaScript to handle all operations dynamically on the client side. For simplicity, we will use an array to simulate a database.

Key Features:
Add Users: Users can be added by entering their details.
Update Users: Users can be updated based on their ID.
Delete Users: Users can be removed from the list.
Filter Users: Filter users by name or other criteria.
View Users: Display all the users in a list format.

Explanation:

HTML Structure:
The form includes fields for the user's name and email, along with an Add User button to submit the data.
A table displays the users and includes buttons to edit and delete each user.
A filter input field allows users to search through the existing users by name.

CSS Styling:
Simple, clean styles for the form, buttons, and table.
Table rows are styled with borders and padding for a clear visual representation.

JavaScript Logic:
Add User: When the "Add User" button is clicked, the user's name and email are added to the users array, and the table is re-rendered.
Render Users: The renderUsers function updates the table to show the current state of the users array.
Edit User: When the "Edit" button is clicked, the user is prompted to enter a new name and email. The user data is updated, and the table is re-rendered.
Delete User: The "Delete" button removes the user from the users array, and the table is updated.
Filter Users: The filterInput field allows users to type and filter the list of users by name. The renderUsers function is called with the filtered list.

Features:
Create: Users can add new entries with a name and email.
Read: The list of users is displayed in a table.
Update: Users can edit an existing user's name and email.
Delete: Users can remove an entry.
Filter: Users can filter the table by typing in the filter input.

How to Use:
Add User: Enter a name and email, then click "Add User" to add the user to the table.
Edit User: Click "Edit" next to a user to modify their name or email.
Delete User: Click "Delete" next to a user to remove them from the table.
Filter: Use the input field at the top of the table to filter users by their name.
