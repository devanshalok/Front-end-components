Explanation

HTML Structure:
The stopwatch has a display to show the time (HH:MM:SS) and three buttons: Start, Stop, and Reset.

CSS Styling:
The buttons are styled with different colors to make them easily distinguishable. Hover effects add a nice touch to the buttons.

JavaScript Functionality:
Start Button: Begins the stopwatch by recording the start time and updating the display every second.
Stop Button: Pauses the stopwatch by stopping the interval.
Reset Button: Resets the elapsed time and stops the interval, resetting the display to 00:00:00.
The time is formatted into hours, minutes, and seconds for a user-friendly display.

Button State Management:
Buttons are disabled/enabled based on the current state of the stopwatch to prevent errors (e.g., stopping a stopwatch that hasnâ€™t started).
The lap button is disabled when the stopwatch is stopped or reset.

Lap Functionality:
A new "Lap" button allows users to record the current elapsed time without stopping the stopwatch.
Each lap is displayed in a scrollable container below the buttons.

JavaScript Changes:
The lap button is only enabled when the stopwatch is running.
When clicked, the lap time is recorded and displayed in a list with a label indicating the lap number.

User Interface:
The lap times are shown in a scrollable div, making it easy to view multiple laps.
