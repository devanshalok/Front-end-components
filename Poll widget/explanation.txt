To implement a poll widget where users can vote for their favorite color by specifying their name, and display the results showing how many votes each color received, we can follow these steps:

Create a Form: The user can enter their name and vote for one of the four colors.
Store Votes: Track votes for each color and associate them with the user's name.
Display Results: Show the total votes for each color after the user submits their vote.

Explanation:

HTML Structure:
The form has two inputs: one for the user's name and one for selecting their favorite color.
The results section is displayed below the form, showing the total votes for each color.

CSS Styling:
The form and results are styled to have a clean and responsive layout, with buttons and input fields styled for good UX.

JavaScript Logic:
Form Submission: When the form is submitted, the user's name and selected color are retrieved.
If the user has already voted (i.e., their name exists in the votedUsers set), an error message is displayed.
If the user is voting for the first time, the vote is recorded, and the results are updated.
Result Display: After each vote, the poll results are updated, and the new vote count for each color is displayed.
Voter Tracking: The votedUsers set keeps track of users who have voted, ensuring that each user can only vote once.

Error Handling:
If a user submits the form without entering a name or selecting a color, or if they try to vote more than once, an error message is displayed.

Features:
Unique Voting: Each user can only vote once based on their name.
Real-Time Results: After each vote, the total votes for each color are updated and displayed.
Error Handling: Users are notified if they try to vote without entering a name or if they try to vote more than once.

sHow It Works:
Voting: Users enter their name and select a color. Once they submit, the vote is recorded and added to the results.
Results Update: The results display is updated in real-time after each vote.
Multiple Voters: The system keeps track of all users who have voted, preventing duplicate voting.
