Implementation Overview
HTML: Set up the form structure with input fields for user data.
CSS: Style the form for a clean and user-friendly appearance.
JavaScript: Add client-side validation to ensure the data is properly formatted before submission.

Explanation
HTML Structure:
The signup form includes input fields for username, email, and password.
Each input field has associated error messages that display when the input is invalid.

CSS Styling:
The form is styled with a modern look, with proper spacing, borders, and hover effects on the button to enhance the user experience.
Error messages are styled in red and are hidden by default, showing only when validation fails.

JavaScript Functionality:
The form has client-side validation to check if the fields are correctly filled before submission.
The JavaScript code checks the username for emptiness, the email for a valid format, and the password for a minimum length.
If validation fails, appropriate error messages are displayed.
On successful validation, a success message is shown, and the form is reset.
